# DeepFloyd IF

> ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training DeepFloyd requires at least 24G VRAM for a LoRA. This guide focuses on the 400M parameter base model, though the 4.3B XL flavour can be trained using the same guidelines.

## Background

In spring of 2023, StabilityAI released a cascaded pixel diffusion model called DeepFloyd.

Comparing briefly to Stable Diffusion XL:
- Text encoder
  - SDXL uses two CLIP encoders, "OpenCLIP G/14" and "OpenAI CLIP-L/14"
  - DeepFloyd uses a single self-supervised transformer model, Google's T5 XXL
- Parameter count
  - DeepFloyd comes in multiple flavours of density: 400M, 900M, and 4.3B parameters. Each larger unit is successively more expensive to train.
  - SDXL has just one, ~3B parameters.
  - DeepFloyd's text encoder has 11B parameters in it alone, making the fattest configuration roughly 15.3B parameters.
- Model count
  - DeepFloyd runs in **three** stages: 64px -> 256px -> 1024px
    - Each stage fully completes its denoising objective
  - SDXL runs in **two** stages, including its refiner, from 1024px -> 1024px
    - Each stage only partly completes its denoising objective
- Design
  - DeepFloyd's three models increase resolution and fine details
  - SDXL's two models manage fine details and composition

For both models, the first stage defines most of the image's composition (where large items / shadows appear).

## Model assessment

Here's what you can expect when using DeepFloyd for training or inference.

### Aesthetics

When compared to SDXL or Stable Diffusion 1.x/2.x, DeepFloyd's aesthetics lie somewhere between Stable Diffusion 2.x and SDXL.


### Disadvantages

This is not a popular model, for various reasons:

- Inference-time compute VRAM requirement is heavier than other models
- Training-time compute VRAM requirements dwarf other models
  - A full u-net tune needing more than 48G VRAM
  - LoRA at rank-32, batch-4 needs ~24G VRAM
  - The text embed cache objects are ENORMOUS (multiple Megabytes each, vs hundreds of Kilobytes for SDXL's dual CLIP embeds)
  - The text embed cache objects are SLOW TO CREATE, about 9-10 per second currently on an A6000 non-Ada.
- The default aesthetic is worse than other models (like trying to train vanilla SD 1.5)
- There's **three** models to finetune or load onto your system during inference (four if you count the text encoder)
- The promises from StabilityAI did not meet the reality of what it felt like to use the model (over-hyped)
- The DeepFloyd-IF license is restrictive against commercial use.
  - This didn't impact the NovelAI weights, which were in fact leaked illicitly. The commercial license nature seems like a convenient excuse, considering the other, bigger issues.

### Advantages

However, DeepFloyd really has its upsides that often go overlooked:

- At inference time, the T5 text encoder demonstrates a strong understanding of the world
- Can be natively trained on very-long captions
- The first stage is ~64x64 pixel area, and can be trained on multi-aspect resolutions
  - The low-resolution nature of the training data means DeepFloyd was _the only model_ capable of training on _ALL_ of LAION-A (few images are under 64x64 in LAION)
- Each stage can be tuned independently, focusing on different objectives
  - The first stage can be tuned focusing on compositional qualities, and the later stages are tuned for better upscaled details
- It trains very quickly despite its larger training memory footprint
  - Trains quicker in terms of throughput - a high samples per hour rate is observed on stage 1 tuning
  - Learns more quickly than a CLIP equivalent model, perhaps to the detriment of people used to training CLIP models
    - In other words, you will have to adjust your expectations of learning rates and training schedules
- There is no VAE, the training samples are directly downscaled into their target size and the pixels are consumed by the U-net
- It supports ControlNet LoRAs and many other tricks that work on typical linear CLIP u-nets.

## Fine-tuning a LoRA

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the compute requirements of full u-net backpropagation in even DeepFloyd's smallest 400M model, it has not been tested. LoRA will be used for this document, though full u-net tuning should also work.

These instructions assume basic familiarity with SimpleTuner. For newcomers, it's recommended to start with a more well-supported model like [Kwai Kolors](/documentation/quickstart/KOLORS.md).

However, if you do wish to train DeepFloyd, it requires the use of the `model_flavour` configuration option to indicate which model you're training.

### config.json

```bash
"model_family": "deepfloyd",

# Possible values:
# - i-medium-400m
# - i-large-900m
# - i-xlarge-4.3b
# - ii-medium-450m
# - ii-large-1.2b
"model_flavour": "i-medium-400m",

# DoRA isn't tested a whole lot yet. It's still new and experimental.
"use_dora": false,
# Bitfit hasn't been tested for efficacy on DeepFloyd.
# It will probably work, but no idea what the outcome is.
"use_bitfit": false,

# Highest learning rate to use.
"learning_rate": 4e-5,
# For schedules that decay or oscillate, this will be the end LR or the bottom of the valley.
"lr_end": 4e-6,
```

- The `model_family` is deepfloyd
- The `model_flavour` is pointing to Stage I or II
- `resolution` is now `64` and `resolution_type` is `pixel`
- `attention_mechanism` can be set to `xformers`, but AMD and Apple users won't be able to set this, requiring more VRAM.
  - **Note** ~~Apple MPS currently has a bug preventing DeepFloyd tuning from working at all.~~ As of Pytorch 2.6 or sometime earlier, stage I and II both train on Apple MPS.

For more thorough validations, the value for `validation_resolution` can be set as:

- `validation_resolution=64` will result in a 64x64 square image.
- `validation_resolution=96x64` will result in a 3:2 widescreen image.
- `validation_resolution=64,96,64x96,96x64` will result in four images being generated for each validation:
  - 64x64
  - 96x96
  - 64x96
  - 96x64

### multidatabackend_deepfloyd.json

Now let's move onto configuring the dataloader for DeepFloyd training. This will be nearly identical to configuration of SDXL or legacy model datasets, with a focus on resolution parameters.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "primary-dataset",
        "type": "local",
        "instance_data_dir": "/training/data/primary-dataset",
        "crop": true,
        "crop_aspect": "square",
        "crop_style": "random",
        "resolution": 64,
        "resolution_type": "pixel",
        "minimum_image_size": 64,
        "maximum_image_size": 256,
        "target_downsample_size": 128,
        "prepend_instance_prompt": false,
        "instance_prompt": "Your Subject Trigger Phrase or Word",
        "caption_strategy": "instanceprompt",
        "repeats": 1
    },
    {
        "id": "an example backend for text embeds.",
        "dataset_type": "text_embeds",
        "default": true,
        "disable": false,
        "type": "local",
        "cache_dir": "/training/cache/deepfloyd/text/dreambooth"
    }
]
```

Provided above is a basic Dreambooth configuration for DeepFloyd:

- The values for `resolution` and `resolution_type` are set to `64` and `pixel`, respectively
- The value for `minimum_image_size` is reduced to 64 pixels to ensure we don't accidentally upsample any smaller images
- The value for `maximum_image_size` is set to 256 pixels to ensure that any large images do not become cropped at a ratio of more than 4:1, which may result in catastrophic scene context loss
- The value for `target_downsample_size` is set to 128 pixels so that any images larger than `maximum_image_size` of 256 pixels are first resized to 128 pixels before cropping

Note: images are downsampled 25% at a time so to avoid extreme leaps in image size causing an incorrect averaging of the scene's details.

## Running inference

Currently, DeepFloyd does not have any dedicated inference scripts in the SimpleTuner toolkit.

Other than the built-in validations process, you may want to reference [this document from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.23.1/en/training/dreambooth#if) which contains a small example for running inference afterward:

```py
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("DeepFloyd/IF-I-M-v1.0", use_safetensors=True)
pipe.load_lora_weights("<lora weights path>")
pipe.scheduler = pipe.scheduler.__class__.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config, variance_type="fixed_small")
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that the first value for `DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(...)` is set to `IF-I-M-v1.0`, but you must update this to use the base model path that you trained your LoRA on.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that not all of the recommendations from Hugging Face apply to SimpleTuner. For example, we can tune DeepFloyd stage I LoRA in just 22G of VRAM vs 28G for Diffusers' example dreambooth scripts thanks to efficient pre-caching and pure-bf16 optimiser states.

## Fine-tuning the super-resolution stage II model

DeepFloyd's stage II model takes inputs around 64x64 (or 96x64) images, and returns the resulting upscaled image using the `VALIDATION_RESOLUTION` setting.

The eval images are automatically collected from your datasets, such that `--num_eval_images` will specify how many upscale images to select from each dataset. The images are currently selected at random - but they'll remain the same on each session.

A few more checks are in place to ensure you don't accidentally run with the incorrect sizes set.

To train stage II, you just need to follow the steps above, using `deepfloyd-stage2-lora` in place of `deepfloyd-lora` for `MODEL_TYPE`:

```bash
export MODEL_TYPE="deepfloyd-stage2-lora"
```
