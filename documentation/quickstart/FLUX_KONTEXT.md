# Kontext \[dev] Mini Quick‑start

> 📝  Kontext shares 90 % of its training workflow with Flux, so this file only lists what *differs*.  When a step is **not** mentioned here, follow the original [instructions](/documentation/quickstart/FLUX.md)

Kontext keeps the Flux transformer backbone but introduces **paired‑reference conditioning**.

Two `conditioning_type` modes are available for Kontext:

* `conditioning_type=reference_loose` (✅ stable) – reference can differ in aspect‐ratio/size from the edit.
  - Both datasets are scanned for metadata, aspect bucketed, and cropped independently of each other, which can substantially increase the startup time.
  - This may be an issue for setups where you'd like to ensure the alignment of the edit and reference images, such as in a dataloader that uses a single image per file name.
* `conditioning_type=reference_strict` (✅ stable) – reference is pre‑transformed exactly like the edit crop.
  - This is how you should configure your datasets if you need perfect alignment between crops / aspect bucketing between your edit and reference images.
  - Originally required `--vae_cache_ondemand` and some increased VRAM usage, but no longer does.
  - Duplicates the crop / aspect bucket metadata from the source dataset at startup, so you don't have to.

## 2. Hardware requirements

* **System RAM**: quantisation still needs 50 GB.
* **GPU**: 3090 (24 G) is the realistic minimum for 1024 px training **with int8‑quanto**.
  * Hopper H100/H200 systems with Flash Attention 3 can enable `--fuse_qkv_projections` to greatly speed up training.
  * If you train at 512 px you can squeeze into a 12 G card, but expect slow batches (sequence length remains large).

## 3. Quick configuration diff

Below is the *smallest* set of changes you need in `config/config.json` compared with your typical Flux training configuration.

```jsonc
{
  "model_family":   "flux",
  "model_flavour": "kontext",                       // <‑‑ change this from "dev" to "kontext"
  "base_model_precision": "int8-quanto",            // fits on 24 G at 1024 px
  "gradient_checkpointing": true,
  "fuse_qkv_projections": false,                    // <‑‑ use this to speed up training on Hopper H100/H200 systems. WARNING: requires flash-attn manually installed.
  "lora_rank": 16,
  "learning_rate": 1e-5,
  "optimizer": "optimi-lion",                       // <‑‑ use Lion for faster results, and adamw_bf16 for slower but possibly more stable results.
  "max_train_steps": 10000,
  "validation_guidance": 2.5,                       // <‑‑ kontext really does best with a guidance value of 2.5
  "validation_resolution": "1024x1024",
  "conditioning_multidataset_sampling": "random"    // <-- setting this to "combined" when you have two conditioning datasets defined will show them simultaneously instead of switching between them.
}
```

### Dataloader snippet (multi‑data‑backend)

If you've manually curated an image-pair dataset, you can configure it using two separate directories: one for the edit images and one for the reference images.

The `conditioning_data` field in the edit dataset should point to the reference dataset's `id`.

```jsonc
[
  {
    "id": "my-edited-images",
    "type": "local",
    "cache_dir_vae": "/cache/vae/flux/kontext/edited-images",   // <-- where VAE outputs are stored
    "instance_data_dir": "/datasets/edited-images",             // <-- use absolute paths
    "conditioning_data": [
      "my-reference-images"                                     // <‑‑ this should be your "id" of the reference set
                                                                // you could specify a second set to alternate between or combine them, e.g. ["reference-images", "reference-images2"]
    ],
    "resolution": 1024,
    "caption_strategy": "textfile"                              // <-- these captions should contain the edit instructions
  },
  {
    "id": "my-reference-images",
    "type": "local",
    "cache_dir_vae": "/cache/vae/flux/kontext/ref-images",      // <-- where VAE outputs are stored. must be different from other dataset VAE paths.
    "instance_data_dir": "/datasets/reference-images",          // <-- use absolute paths
    "conditioning_type": "reference_strict",                    // <‑‑ if this is set to reference_loose, the images are cropped independently of the edit images
    "resolution": 1024,
    "caption_strategy": null,                                   // <‑‑ no captions needed for references, but if available, will be used INSTEAD of the edit captions
                                                                // NOTE: you cannot define separate conditioning captions when using conditioning_multidataset_sampling=combined.
                                                                // Only the edit datasets' captions will be used.
  }
]
```

*Every edit image **must** have 1‑to‑1 matching file names and extensions in both dataset folders. SimpleTuner will automatically staple the reference embedding to the edit’s conditioning.

A prepared example [Kontext Max derived demo dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/terminusresearch/KontextMax-Edit-smol) which contains reference and edit images along with their caption textfiles is available for browsing to get a better idea of how to set it up.

### Setting up a dedicated validation split

Here's an example configuration that uses a training set with 200,000 samples and a validation set with just a few.

In your `config.json` you'll want to add:

```json
{
  "eval_dataset_id": "edited-images",
}
```

For your `multidatabackend.json`, `edited-images` and `reference-images` should contain validation data with the same layout as a usual training split.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "edited-images",
        "disabled": false,
        "type": "local",
        "instance_data_dir": "/datasets/edit/edited-images",

            "composite_image_config": {
                "enabled": true,
                "image_count": 2,
                "select_index": 0
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "subjects200k-right",

            "composite_image_config": {
                "enabled": true,
                "image_count": 2,
                "select_index": 1
            }
        }
    },

    {
        "id": "text-embed-cache",
        "dataset_type": "text_embeds",
        "default": true,
        "type": "local",
        "cache_dir": "cache/text/flux"
    }
]
```

### Automatic Reference-Edit Pair Generation

If you don't have pre-existing reference-edit pairs, SimpleTuner can automatically generate them from a single dataset. This is particularly useful for training models for:
- Image enhancement / super-resolution
- JPEG artifact removal
- Deblurring
- Other restoration tasks

#### Example: Deblurring Training Dataset

```jsonc
[
  {
    "id": "high-quality-images",
    "type": "local",
    "instance_data_dir": "/path/to/sharp-images",
    "resolution": 1024,
    "caption_strategy": "textfile",
    "conditioning": [
      {
        "type": "superresolution",
        "blur_radius": 3.0,
        "blur_type": "gaussian",
        "add_noise": true,
        "noise_level": 0.02,
        "captions": ["enhance sharpness", "deblur", "increase clarity", "sharpen image"]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "text-embeds",
    "dataset_type": "text_embeds",
    "default": true,
    "type": "local",
    "cache_dir": "cache/text/kontext"
  }
]
```

This configuration will:
1. Create blurred versions (these become the "reference" images) from your high-quality sharp images
2. Use the original high-quality images as the training loss target
3. Train Kontext to enhance/deblur the poor-quality reference image

> **NOTE**: You can't define `captions` on a conditioning dataset when using `conditioning_multidataset_sampling=combined`. The edit dataset's captions will be used instead.

#### Example: JPEG Artifact Removal

```jsonc
[
  {
    "id": "pristine-images",
    "type": "local",
    "instance_data_dir": "/path/to/pristine-images",
    "resolution": 1024,
    "caption_strategy": "textfile",
    "conditioning": [
      {
        "type": "jpeg_artifacts",
        "quality_mode": "range",
        "quality_range": [10, 30],
        "compression_rounds": 2,
        "captions": ["remove compression artifacts", "restore quality", "fix jpeg artifacts"]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "text-embeds",
    "dataset_type": "text_embeds",
    "default": true,
    "type": "local",
    "cache_dir": "cache/text/kontext"
  }
]
```

#### Important Notes

1. **Generation happens at startup**: The degraded versions are created automatically when training begins
2. **Caching**: Generated images are saved, so subsequent runs won't regenerate them
3. **Caption strategy**: The `captions` field in the conditioning config provides task-specific prompts that work better than generic image descriptions
4. **Performance**: These CPU-based generators (blur, JPEG) are fast and use multiple processes
5. **Disk space**: Ensure you have enough disk space for the generated images, as they can be large! Unfortunately, there is no ability to create them on-demand yet.

For more conditioning types and advanced configurations, see the [ControlNet documentation](/documentation/CONTROLNET.md).

## 4. Training tips specific to Kontext

1. **Longer sequences → slower steps.**  Expect \~0.4 it/s on a single 4090 at 1024 px, rank‑1 LoRA, bf16 + int8.
2. **Explore for the correct settings.**  Not a lot is known about fine-tuning Kontext; for safety, stay at `1e‑5` (Lion) or `5e‑4` (AdamW).
3. **Watch VRAM spikes during VAE caching.**  If you OOM, add `--offload_during_startup=true`, lower your `resolution`, or possibly enable VAE tiling via your `config.json`.
4. **You can train it without reference images, but not currently via SimpleTuner.**  Currently, things are somewhat hardcoded toward requiring conditional images to be supplied, but you can provide normal datasets alongside your edit pairs to allow it to learn subjects and likeness.
5. **Guidance re‑distillation.**  Like Flux‑dev, Kontext‑dev is CFG‑distilled; if you need diversity, retrain with `validation_guidance_real > 1` and use an Adaptive‑Guidance node at inference, though this will take a LOT longer to converge, and will require a large rank LoRA or a Lycoris LoKr to succeed.
6. **Full-rank training is probably a waste of time.** Kontext is designed to be trained with low rank, and full rank training will likely not yield any better results than a Lycoris LoKr, which will typically outperform a Standard LoRA with less work chasing the best parameters.  If you want to try it anyway, you'll have to use DeepSpeed.
7. **You can use two or more reference images for training.** As an example, if you have subject-subject-scene images for inserting the two subjects into a single scene, you can provide all relevant images as reference inputs. Simply ensure the filenames all match across folders.

---

## 5. Inference gotchas

- Match your training and inference precision levels; int8 training will do best with int8 inference and so on.
- It's going to be very slow due to the fact that two images are running through the system at a time.  Expect 80 s per 1024 px edit on a 4090.

## 6. Troubleshooting cheat‑sheet

| Symptom                                 | Likely cause               | Quick fix                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| OOM during quantisation                 | Not enough **system** RAM  | Use `quantize_via=cpu`                                 |
| Ref image ignored / no edit applied     | Dataloader mis‑pairing     | Ensure identical filenames & `conditioning_data` field |
| Square grid artifacts                   | Low‑quality edits dominate | Make higher-quality dataset, lower LR, avoid Lion      |
