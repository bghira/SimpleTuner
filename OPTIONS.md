# SimpleTuner Training Script Options

## Overview

This guide provides a user-friendly breakdown of the command-line options available in SimpleTuner's `train_sdxl.py` script. These options offer a high degree of customization, allowing you to train your model to suit your specific requirements.

---

## 🌟 Core Model Configuration

### `--pretrained_model_name_or_path`

- **What**: Path to the pretrained model or its identifier from huggingface.co/models.
- **Why**: To specify the base model you'll start training from.

### `--hub_model_id`

- **What**: The name of the Huggingface Hub model and local results directory.
- **Why**: This value is used as the directory name under the location specified as `--output_dir`. If `--push_to_hub` is provided, this will become the name of the model on Huggingface Hub.
---

### `--push_to_hub`

- **What**: If provided, your model will be uploaded to [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co) once training completes.

## 📂 Data Storage and Management

### `--instance_data_dir`

- **What**: Folder containing the training data.
- **Why**: Designates where your training images and other data are stored.

### `--data_backend`

- **What**: Specifies the data storage backend, either 'local' or 'aws'.
- **Why**: Allows for seamless switching between local and cloud storage.

---

## 🌈 Image and Text Processing

### `--resolution`

- **What**: Input image resolution. Can be expressed as pixels, or megapixels.
- **Why**: All images in the dataset will have their smaller edge resized to this resolution for training. If you use 1024px, the images may become very large and use an excessive amount of VRAM. The best mileage tends to be a 768 or 800 pixel base resolution, although 512px resolution training can really pay off with SDXL in particular.

### `--resolution_type`

- **What**: This tells SimpleTuner whether to use `area` size calculations or `pixel` edge calculations.
- **Why**: SimpleTuner's default `pixel` behaviour is to resize the image, keeping the aspect ratio. Setting the type to `area` instead uses the given megapixel value as the target size for the image, keeping the aspect ratio.

### `--validation_resolution`

- **What**: Output image resolution, measured in pixels.
- **Why**: All images generated during validation will be this resolution. Useful if the model is being trained with a different resolution.

### `--caption_strategy`

- **What**: Strategy for deriving image captions. __Choices__: `textfile`, `filename`
- **Why**: Determines how captions are generated for training images. `textfile` will use the contents of a `.txt` file with the same filename as the image, and `filename` will apply some cleanup to the filename before using it as the caption.

---

## 🎛 Training Parameters

### `--num_train_epochs`

- **What**: Number of training epochs (the number of times that all images are seen)
- **Why**: Determines the number of image repeats, which impacts the duration of the training process. More epochs tends to result in overfitting, but might be required to pick up the concepts you wish to train in. A reasonable value might be from 5 to 50.

### `--max_train_steps`

- **What**: Number of training steps to exit training after.
- **Why**: Useful for shortening the length of training.

### `--train_batch_size`

- **What**: Batch size for the training data loader.
- **Why**: Affects the model's memory consumption, convergence quality, and training speed. The higher the batch size, the better the results will be, but a very high batch size might result in overfitting or destabilized training, as well as increasing the duration of the training session unnecessarily. Experimentation is warranted, but in general, you want to try to max out your video memory while not decreasing the training speed.

---

## 🛠 Advanced Optimizations

### `--gradient_accumulation_steps`

- **What**: Number of update steps to accumulate before performing a backward/update pass.
- **Why**: Useful for handling larger models or datasets.

### `--learning_rate`

- **What**: Initial learning rate after potential warmup.
- **Why**: The learning rate designates how much the weights and biases are nudged on each optimisation step. A minimal value might be as low as `4e-7` and a maximal value would likely be as high as `1e-6`. When a higher learning rate is used, it's advantageous to use an EMA network with a learning rate warmup - see `--use_ema` and `--lr_warmup_steps`.

### `--snr_gamma`

- **What**: Utilising min-SNR weighted loss factor.
- **Why**: Though it does not currently work with zero terminal SNR models, min-SNR on an epsilon / offset noise model can greatly assist with convergence. Value recommended by the original paper is **5** but you can use values as low as **1** or as high as **20**.

---

## 🔄 Checkpointing and Resumption

### `--checkpointing_steps`

- **What**: Interval at which training state checkpoints are saved.
- **Why**: Useful for resuming training and for inference. Every _n_ iterations, a partial checkpoint will be saved in the `.safetensors` format, via the Diffusers filesystem layout.

### `--resume_from_checkpoint`

- **What**: Specifies if and from where to resume training.
- **Why**: Allows you to continue training from a saved state, either manually specified or the latest available. A checkpoint is composed of a `unet` and optionally, an `ema_unet`. The `unet` may be dropped into any Diffusers layout SDXL model, allowing it to be used as a normal model would.

---

## 📊 Logging and Monitoring

### `--logging_dir`

- **What**: Directory for TensorBoard logs.
- **Why**: Allows you to monitor training progress and performance metrics.

### `--report_to`

- **What**: Specifies the platform for reporting results and logs.
- **Why**: Enables integration with platforms like TensorBoard, wandb, or comet_ml for monitoring.

The following SimpleTuner command-line options are available:

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --snr_gamma SNR_GAMMA
                        SNR weighting gamma to be used if rebalancing the loss. Recommended value is 5.0. More details here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09556.
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path PRETRAINED_MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH
                        Path to pretrained model or model identifier from huggingface.co/models.
  --pretrained_vae_model_name_or_path PRETRAINED_VAE_MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH
                        Path to an improved VAE to stabilize training. For more details check out: https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/4038.
  --prediction_type {epsilon,v_prediction,sample}
                        The type of prediction to use for the u-net. Choose between ['epsilon', 'v_prediction', 'sample']. For SD 2.1-v, this is v_prediction. For 2.1-base, it is epsilon. SDXL is generally epsilon. SD 1.5 is
                        epsilon.
  --snr_weight SNR_WEIGHT
                        When training a model using `--prediction_type=sample`, one can supply an SNR weight value to augment the loss with. If a value of 0.5 is provided here, the loss is taken half from the SNR and half
                        from the MSE.
  --training_scheduler_timestep_spacing {leading,linspace,trailing}
                        Spacing timesteps can fundamentally alter the course of history. Er, I mean, your model weights. For all training, including epsilon, it would seem that 'trailing' is the right choice.
  --inference_scheduler_timestep_spacing {leading,linspace,trailing}
                        The Bytedance paper on zero terminal SNR recommends inference using 'trailing'.
  --timestep_bias_strategy {earlier,later,range,none}
                        The timestep bias strategy, which may help direct the model toward learning low or frequency details. Choices: ['earlier', 'later', 'none']. The default is 'none', which means no bias is applied, and
                        training proceeds normally. The value of 'later' will prefer to generate samples for later timesteps.
  --timestep_bias_multiplier TIMESTEP_BIAS_MULTIPLIER
                        The multiplier for the bias. Defaults to 1.0, which means no bias is applied. A value of 2.0 will double the weight of the bias, and a value of 0.5 will halve it.
  --timestep_bias_begin TIMESTEP_BIAS_BEGIN
                        When using `--timestep_bias_strategy=range`, the beginning timestep to bias. Defaults to zero, which equates to having no specific bias.
  --timestep_bias_end TIMESTEP_BIAS_END
                        When using `--timestep_bias_strategy=range`, the final timestep to bias. Defaults to 1000, which is the number of timesteps that SDXL Base and SD 2.x were trained on.
  --timestep_bias_portion TIMESTEP_BIAS_PORTION
                        The portion of timesteps to bias. Defaults to 0.25, which 25 percent of timesteps will be biased. A value of 0.5 will bias one half of the timesteps. The value provided for `--timestep_bias_strategy`
                        determines whether the biased portions are in the earlier or later timesteps.
  --rescale_betas_zero_snr
                        If set, will rescale the betas to zero terminal SNR. This is recommended for training with v_prediction. For epsilon, this might help with fine details, but will not result in contrast improvements.
  --vae_dtype VAE_DTYPE
                        The dtype of the VAE model. Choose between ['default', 'fp16', 'fp32', 'bf16'].The default VAE dtype is float32, due to NaN issues in SDXL 1.0.
  --vae_batch_size VAE_BATCH_SIZE
                        When pre-caching latent vectors, this is the batch size to use. Decreasing this may help with VRAM issues, but if you are at that point of contention, it's possible that your GPU has too little RAM.
                        Default: 4.
  --keep_vae_loaded     If set, will keep the VAE loaded in memory. This can reduce disk churn, but consumes VRAM during the forward pass.
  --skip_file_discovery SKIP_FILE_DISCOVERY
                        Comma-separated values of which stages to skip discovery for. Skipping any stage will speed up resumption, but will increase the risk of errors, as missing images or incorrectly bucketed images may
                        not be caught. 'vae' will skip the VAE cache process, 'aspect' will not build any aspect buckets, and 'text' will avoid text embed management. Valid options: aspect, vae, text.
  --revision REVISION   Revision of pretrained model identifier from huggingface.co/models. Trainable model components should be float32 precision.
  --tokenizer_name TOKENIZER_NAME
                        Pretrained tokenizer name or path if not the same as model_name
  --instance_data_dir INSTANCE_DATA_DIR
                        A folder containing the training data. Folder contents must either follow the structure described in the SimpleTuner documentation (https://github.com/bghira/SimpleTuner), or the structure described
                        in https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/image_dataset#imagefolder. For 🤗 Datasets in particular, a `metadata.jsonl` file must exist to provide the captions for the images. For SimpleTuner layout, the
                        images can be in subfolders. No particular config is required. Ignored if `dataset_name` is specified.
  --cache_dir_text CACHE_DIR_TEXT
                        This is the path to a local directory that will contain your text embed cache.
  --cache_dir_vae CACHE_DIR_VAE
                        This is the path to a local directory that will contain your VAE outputs. Unlike the text embed cache, your VAE latents will be stored in the AWS data backend. If the AWS backend is in use, this will
                        be a prefix for the bucket's VAE cache entries.
  --data_backend {local,aws}
                        The data backend to use. Choose between ['local', 'aws']. Default: local. If using AWS, you must set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
  --write_batch_size WRITE_BATCH_SIZE
                        When using certain storage backends, it is better to batch smaller writes rather than continuous dispatching. In SimpleTuner, write batching is currently applied during VAE caching, when many small
                        objects are written. This mostly applies to S3, but some shared server filesystems may benefit as well, eg. Ceph. Default: 64.
  --apply_dataset_padding
                        If set, will apply padding to the dataset to ensure that the number of images is divisible by the batch. This has some side-effects (especially on smaller datasets) of over-sampling and overly
                        repeating images.
  --aws_config_file AWS_CONFIG_FILE
                        Path to the AWS configuration file in JSON format. Config key names are the same as SimpleTuner option counterparts.
  --aws_bucket_name AWS_BUCKET_NAME
                        The AWS bucket name to use.
  --aws_bucket_image_prefix AWS_BUCKET_IMAGE_PREFIX
                        Instead of using --instance_data_dir, AWS S3 relies on aws_bucket_*_prefix parameters. When provided, this parameter will be prepended to the image path.
  --aws_endpoint_url AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
                        The AWS server to use. If not specified, will use the default server for the region specified. For Wasabi, use https://s3.wasabisys.com.
  --aws_region_name AWS_REGION_NAME
                        The AWS region to use. If not specified, will use the default region for the server specified. For example, if you specify 's3.amazonaws.com', the default region will be 'us-east-1'.
  --aws_access_key_id AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
                        The AWS access key ID.
  --aws_secret_access_key AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
                        The AWS secret access key.
  --cache_dir CACHE_DIR
                        The directory where the downloaded models and datasets will be stored.
  --cache_clear_validation_prompts
                        When provided, any validation prompt entries in the text embed cache will be recreated. This is useful if you've modified any of the existing prompts, or, disabled/enabled Compel, via
                        `--disable_compel`
  --dataset_name DATASET_NAME
                        The name of the Dataset (from the HuggingFace hub) to train on (could be your own, possibly private, dataset). It can also be a path pointing to a local copy of a dataset in your filesystem, or to a
                        folder containing files that 🤗 Datasets can understand.
  --dataset_config_name DATASET_CONFIG_NAME
                        The config of the Dataset, leave as None if there's only one config.
  --image_column IMAGE_COLUMN
                        The column of the dataset containing the original image on which edits where made.
  --image_prompt_column IMAGE_PROMPT_COLUMN
                        The column of the dataset containing the caption.
  --seen_state_path SEEN_STATE_PATH
                        Where the JSON document containing the state of the seen images is stored. This helps ensure we do not repeat images too many times.
  --state_path STATE_PATH
                        A JSON document containing the current state of training, will be placed here.
  --caption_strategy {filename,textfile,instance_prompt}
                        The default captioning strategy, 'filename', will use the filename as the caption, after stripping some characters like underscores.The 'textfile' strategy will use the contents of a text file with
                        the same name as the image.
  --instance_prompt INSTANCE_PROMPT
                        This is unused. Filenames will be the captions instead.
  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        The output directory where the model predictions and checkpoints will be written.
  --seed SEED           A seed for reproducible training.
  --seed_for_each_device SEED_FOR_EACH_DEVICE
                        By default, a unique seed will be used for each GPU. This is done deterministically, so that each GPU will receive the same seed across invocations. If --seed_for_each_device=false is provided, then
                        we will use the same seed across all GPUs, which will almost certainly result in the over-sampling of inputs on larger datasets.
  --resolution RESOLUTION
                        The resolution for input images, all the images in the train/validation dataset will be resized to this resolution. If using --resolution_type=area, this float value represents megapixels.
  --resolution_type {pixel,area}
                        Resizing images maintains aspect ratio. This defines the resizing strategy. If 'pixel', the images will be resized to the resolution by pixel edge. If 'area', the images will be resized so the pixel
                        area is this many megapixels.
  --minimum_image_size MINIMUM_IMAGE_SIZE
                        The minimum resolution for both sides of input images. If --delete_unwanted_images is set, images smaller than this will be DELETED.
  --crops_coords_top_left_h CROPS_COORDS_TOP_LEFT_H
                        Coordinate for (the height) to be included in the crop coordinate embeddings needed by SDXL UNet.
  --crops_coords_top_left_w CROPS_COORDS_TOP_LEFT_W
                        Coordinate for (the height) to be included in the crop coordinate embeddings needed by SDXL UNet.
  --center_crop         Whether to center crop the input images to the resolution. If not set, the images will be randomly cropped. The images will be resized to the resolution first before cropping. If training SDXL, the
                        VAE cache and aspect bucket cache will need to be (re)built so they include crop coordinates.
  --random_flip         whether to randomly flip images horizontally
  --train_text_encoder  Whether to train the text encoder. If set, the text encoder should be float32 precision.
  --train_batch_size TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size (per device) for the training dataloader.

                        Save a checkpoint of the training state every X updates. Checkpoints can be used for resuming training via `--resume_from_checkpoint`. In the case that the checkpoint is better than the final trained
                        model, the checkpoint can also be used for inference.Using a checkpoint for inference requires separate loading of the original pipeline and the individual checkpointed model components.See

  --logging_dir LOGGING_DIR
                        [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) log directory. Will default to *output_dir/runs/**CURRENT_DATETIME_HOSTNAME***.
  --validation_torch_compile VALIDATION_TORCH_COMPILE
                        Supply `--validation_torch_compile=true` to enable the use of torch.compile() on the validation pipeline. For some setups, torch.compile() may error out. This is dependent on PyTorch version, phase of
                        the moon, but if it works, you should leave it enabled for a great speed-up.
  --validation_torch_compile_mode {reduce-overhead,default}
                        PyTorch provides different modes for the Torch Inductor when compiling graphs. reduce-overhead, the default mode, provides the most benefit.
  --allow_tf32          Whether or not to allow TF32 on Ampere GPUs. Can be used to speed up training. For more information, see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#tensorfloat-32-tf32-on-ampere-devices
  --report_to REPORT_TO
                        The integration to report the results and logs to. Supported platforms are `"tensorboard"` (default), `"wandb"` and `"comet_ml"`. Use `"all"` to report to all integrations.
  --track_luminance     When provided, the luminance of the images will be tracked during training. This has a pretty substantial compute cost for higher resolution images, though it is easily justified when training with
                        offset noise or some other noise modification technique that could bias the model toward very-dark images.
  --tracker_run_name TRACKER_RUN_NAME
                        The name of the run to track with the tracker.
  --tracker_project_name TRACKER_PROJECT_NAME
                        The name of the project for WandB or Tensorboard.
  --validation_prompt VALIDATION_PROMPT
                        A prompt that is used during validation to verify that the model is learning.
  --validation_prompt_library
                        If this is provided, the SimpleTuner prompt library will be used to generate multiple images.
  --user_prompt_library USER_PROMPT_LIBRARY
                        This should be a path to the JSON file containing your prompt library. See user_prompt_library.json.example.
  --num_validation_images NUM_VALIDATION_IMAGES
                        Number of images that should be generated during validation with `validation_prompt`.
  --validation_steps VALIDATION_STEPS
                        Run validation every X steps. Validation consists of running the prompt `args.validation_prompt` multiple times: `args.num_validation_images` and logging the images.
  --validation_num_inference_steps VALIDATION_NUM_INFERENCE_STEPS
                        The default scheduler, DDIM, benefits from more steps. UniPC can do well with just 10-15. For more speed during validations, reduce this value. For better quality, increase it. For model distilation,
                        you will likely want to keep this low.
  --validation_resolution VALIDATION_RESOLUTION
                        Square resolution images will be output at this resolution (256x256).
  --validation_noise_scheduler {ddim,ddpm,euler,euler-a,unipc}
                        When validating the model at inference time, a different scheduler may be chosen. UniPC can offer better speed, and Euler A can put up with instabilities a bit better. For zero-terminal SNR models,
                        DDIM is the best choice. Choices: ['ddim', 'ddpm', 'euler', 'euler-a', 'unipc'], Default: ddim
  --disable_compel      If provided, prompts will be handled using the typical prompt encoding strategy. Otherwise, the default behaviour is to use Compel for prompt embed generation.
  --enable_watermark    The SDXL 0.9 and 1.0 licenses both require a watermark be used to identify any images created to be shared. Since the images created during validation typically are not shared, and we want the most
                        accurate results, this watermarker is disabled by default. If you are sharing the validation images, it is up to you to ensure that you are complying with the license, whether that is through this
                        watermarker, or another.
  --mixed_precision {no,fp16,bf16}
                        Whether to use mixed precision. Choose between fp16 and bf16 (bfloat16). Bf16 requires PyTorch >= 1.10.and an Nvidia Ampere GPU. Default to the value of accelerate config of the current system or the
                        flag passed with the `accelerate.launch` command. Use this argument to override the accelerate config.
  --local_rank LOCAL_RANK
                        For distributed training: local_rank
  --enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention
                        Whether or not to use xformers.
  --set_grads_to_none   Save more memory by using setting grads to None instead of zero. Be aware, that this changes certain behaviors, so disable this argument if it causes any problems. More info:
                        https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Optimizer.zero_grad.html
  --noise_offset NOISE_OFFSET
                        The scale of noise offset. Default: 0.1
  --validation_epochs VALIDATION_EPOCHS
                        Run validation every X epochs.
  --validation_guidance VALIDATION_GUIDANCE
                        CFG value for validation images. Default: 7.5
  --validation_guidance_rescale VALIDATION_GUIDANCE_RESCALE
                        CFG rescale value for validation images. Default: 0.0, max 1.0
  --validation_randomize
                        If supplied, validations will be random, ignoring any seeds.
  --validation_seed VALIDATION_SEED
                        If not supplied, the value for --seed will be used. If neither those nor --validation_randomize are supplied, a seed of zero is used.
  --fully_unload_text_encoder
                        If set, will fully unload the text_encoder from memory when not in use. This currently has the side effect of crashing validations, but it is useful for initiating VAE caching on GPUs that would
                        otherwise be too small.
  --freeze_encoder_before FREEZE_ENCODER_BEFORE
                        When using 'before' strategy, we will freeze layers earlier than this.
  --freeze_encoder_after FREEZE_ENCODER_AFTER
                        When using 'after' strategy, we will freeze layers later than this.
  --freeze_encoder_strategy FREEZE_ENCODER_STRATEGY
                        When freezing the text_encoder, we can use the 'before', 'between', or 'after' strategy. The 'between' strategy will freeze layers between those two values, leaving the outer layers unfrozen. The
                        default strategy is to freeze all layers from 17 up. This can be helpful when fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 2.1 on a new style.
  --print_filenames     If any image files are stopping the process eg. due to corruption or truncation, this will help identify which is at fault.
  --debug_aspect_buckets
                        If set, will print excessive debugging for aspect bucket operations.
  --debug_dataset_loader
                        If set, will print excessive debugging for data loader operations.
  --freeze_encoder      Whether or not to freeze the text_encoder. The default is true.
  --text_encoder_limit TEXT_ENCODER_LIMIT
                        When training the text_encoder, we want to limit how long it trains for to avoid catastrophic loss.
  --prepend_instance_prompt
                        When determining the captions from the filename, prepend the instance prompt as an enforced keyword.
  --only_instance_prompt
                        Use the instance prompt instead of the caption from filename.
  --caption_dropout_interval CAPTION_DROPOUT_INTERVAL
                        Every X steps, we will drop the caption from the input to assist in classifier-free guidance training. When StabilityAI trained Stable Diffusion, a value of 10 was used. Very high values might be
                        useful to do some sort of enforced style training. Default value is zero, maximum value is 100.
  --conditioning_dropout_probability CONDITIONING_DROPOUT_PROBABILITY
                        Conditioning dropout probability. Experimental. See section 3.2.1 in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09800.
  --caption_dropout_probability CAPTION_DROPOUT_PROBABILITY
                        Caption dropout probability. Same as caption_dropout_interval, but this is for SDXL.
  --input_pertubation INPUT_PERTUBATION
                        The scale of input pretubation. Recommended 0.1.
  --use_original_images USE_ORIGINAL_IMAGES
                        When this option is provided, image cropping and processing will be disabled. It is a good idea to use this with caution, for training multiple aspect ratios.
  --delete_unwanted_images
                        If set, will delete images that are not of a minimum size to save on disk space for large training runs. Default behaviour: Unset, remove images from bucket only.
  --delete_problematic_images
                        If set, any images that error out during load will be removed from the underlying storage medium. This is useful to prevent repeatedly attempting to cache bad files on a cloud bucket.
  --offset_noise        Fine-tuning against a modified noise See: https://www.crosslabs.org//blog/diffusion-with-offset-noise for more information.
  --learning_rate_end LEARNING_RATE_END
                        A polynomial learning rate will end up at this value after the specified number of warmup steps.
