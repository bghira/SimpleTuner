    Calls the scheduler's `set_timesteps` method and retrieves timesteps from the scheduler after the call. Handles
    custom timesteps. Any kwargs will be supplied to `scheduler.set_timesteps`.

    Args:
        scheduler (`SchedulerMixin`):
            The scheduler to get timesteps from.
        num_inference_steps (`int`):
            The number of diffusion steps used when generating samples with a pre-trained model. If used, `timesteps`
            must be `None`.
        device (`str` or `torch.device`, *optional*):
            The device to which the timesteps should be moved to. If `None`, the timesteps are not moved.
        timesteps (`List[int]`, *optional*):
            Custom timesteps used to override the timestep spacing strategy of the scheduler. If `timesteps` is passed,
            `num_inference_steps` and `sigmas` must be `None`.
        sigmas (`List[float]`, *optional*):
            Custom sigmas used to override the timestep spacing strategy of the scheduler. If `sigmas` is passed,
            `num_inference_steps` and `timesteps` must be `None`.

        `Tuple[torch.Tensor, int]`: A tuple where the first element is the timestep schedule from the scheduler and the
        second element is the number of inference steps.
