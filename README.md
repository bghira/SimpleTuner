## Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Aiming to have good default settings for most use cases, so less tinkering is required.
- **Versatility**: Designed to handle a wide range of image quantities - from small datasets to extensive collections.
- **Cutting-Edge Features**: Only incorporates features that have proven efficacy, avoiding the addition of untested options.

## Tutorial

Please fully explore this README before embarking on [the tutorial](/documentation/TUTORIAL.md), as it contains vital information that you might need to know first.

For a quick start without reading the full documentation, you can use the [Quick Start](/documentation/QUICKSTART.md) guide.

For memory-constrained systems, see the [DeepSpeed document](/documentation/DEEPSPEED.md) which explains how to use ü§óAccelerate to configure Microsoft's DeepSpeed for optimiser state offload.

For multi-node distributed training, [this guide](/documentation/DISTRIBUTED.md) will help tweak the configurations from the INSTALL and Quickstart guides to be suitable for multi-node training, and optimising for image datasets numbering in the billions of samples.

## Hardware Requirements

### General Requirements

- **NVIDIA**: RTX 3080+ recommended (tested up to H200)
- **AMD**: 7900 XTX 24GB and MI300X verified (higher memory usage vs NVIDIA)
- **Apple**: M3 Max+ with 24GB+ unified memory for LoRA training

### Memory Guidelines by Model Size

- **Large models (12B+)**: A100-80G for full-rank, 24G+ for LoRA/Lycoris
- **Medium models (2B-8B)**: 16G+ for LoRA, 40G+ for full-rank training
- **Small models (<2B)**: 12G+ sufficient for most training types

**Note**: Quantization (int8/fp8/nf4) significantly reduces memory requirements. See individual [quickstart guides](#quickstart-guides) for model-specific requirements.

## Setup

SimpleTuner can be installed via pip for most users:

```bash
# Base installation (CPU-only PyTorch)
pip install simpletuner

# CUDA users (NVIDIA GPUs)
pip install simpletuner[cuda]

# ROCm users (AMD GPUs)
pip install simpletuner[rocm]

# Apple Silicon users (M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs)
pip install simpletuner[apple]
```

For manual installation or development setup, see the [installation documentation](/documentation/INSTALL.md).

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logs for a more detailed insight by adding `export SIMPLETUNER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to your environment (`config/config.env`) file.

For performance analysis of the training loop, setting `SIMPLETUNER_TRAINING_LOOP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` will have timestamps that highlight any issues in your configuration.

For a comprehensive list of options available, consult [this documentation](/documentation/OPTIONS.md).
